# Hop: Navigation and routing matchers for Elm SPAs

[![Build Status](https://semaphoreci.com/api/v1/sporto/hop/branches/master/badge.svg)](https://semaphoreci.com/sporto/hop)

![alt Hop](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sporto/hop/master/assets/logo.png)

Hop is meant to be used with [the Elm Navigation package](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/navigation/). 

On top of Elm Navigation Hop provides:

- Matchers for URL parsing
- Support for nested routes
- A helper for reverse routing
- Transparent support for push or hash routing
- Helpers for changing the query string

## Getting Started

Please see this [example app](https://github.com/sporto/hop/blob/master/examples/basic/Main.elm). It explains how to wire everything in the comments.

### Hash routing

A proper url should have the query before the hash e.g. `?keyword=Ja#/users/1`,
but when using hash routing, query parameters are appended after the hash path e.g. `#/users/1?keyword=Ja`. 
This is done for aesthetics and so the router is fully controlled by the hash fragment.
